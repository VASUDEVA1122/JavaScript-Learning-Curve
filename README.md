## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of learning JavaScript. Each program demonstrates a fundamental concept, such as loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, and more.

I started by writing simple scripts and gradually built up to more complex applications. The goal is to showcase my learning progress, solve problems, and practice coding in a hands-on way.

## Programs

Below are the JavaScript programs I've worked on so far:

1. **Write the program to greet a person given their first and last name** - A basic program to greet a person based on their full name.
2. **Write a program that greets a person based on their gender (If else)** - A program that greets a person based on their gender.
3. **Write a program that counts from 0 - 1000 and prints (for Loops)** - Prints all the numbers from 0 to 1000 using a loop.
4. **Write a program that reverses all the elements of an array** - Reverses the order of elements in an array.
5. **Write a program that prints all the even numbers in an array** - Filters and prints even numbers from an array.
6. **Write a program to print the biggest number in an array** - Finds and prints the largest number in an array.
7. **Write a program that prints all the male people's first name given a complex object** - Prints the first names of all male people from a list of complex objects.
8. **Create a counter in JavaScript (counts down from 30 to 0)** - A program that counts down from 30 to 0.
9. **Calculate the time it takes between a setTimeout call and the inner function actually running** - Measures the time taken for a `setTimeout` function to execute.
10. **Create a terminal clock (HH:MM:SS)** - A program that displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format.

Each of these programs is a building block of my JavaScript journey and serves as an example of my progress.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core language used for all the programs.
- **VS Code**: The code editor I used to write and test the programs.
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and sharing my progress.
